# Serverless Student Management System

### 1. Executive Summary

Serverless Student Management Platform is a cloud-based student management platform designed for educational institutions and small businesses to enhance the ability to manage, analyze, and interact with student data. The platform supports up to 50-100 students initially, with the ability to flexibly scale up to 500–1000 students without major infrastructure changes, using AWS Serverless services such as Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway.

### 2. Problem Statement

**Current Problem**

Current student management systems require manual data entry, which is difficult to manage when there are many classes. There is no centralized system for real-time data or analytics, and third-party platforms are often expensive and too complex.

**Solution**

The platform uses Amazon API Gateway to receive REST requests, AWS Lambda to handle business logic, Amazon DynamoDB to store student data and scores. AWS Amplify with React/TypeScript provides the web interface, and Amazon Cognito ensures secure access. Similar to traditional LMS systems but at a lower cost, users can register new students and manage information, but the platform operates at a smaller scale and serves learning purposes.

**Benefits and ROI**

The solution creates a basic foundation for IT students to develop serverless AWS skills, while providing effective management tools for teachers to support teaching and assessment. The platform reduces manual reporting for each class through a centralized system, simplifies management and maintenance, and improves data reliability. The estimated monthly cost is $7-20 USD according to the detailed budget estimate, totaling $40-60 USD for 3 months.

### 3. Solution Architecture

The system is designed according to the AWS Well-Architected Framework architecture with interconnected layers, ensuring data management, authentication, and monitoring capabilities. The serverless architecture helps optimize costs and ensure automatic scalability.

### 7. Risk Assessment

Based on the NIST Risk Management Framework, the project team identified key risks and mitigation measures.

| **Risk Code** | **Description** | **Level** | **Mitigation** |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **R1 – Data Leakage** | Data exposure due to incorrect configuration | **High** | Apply Cognito auth, IAM least privilege, DynamoDB encryption |
| **R2 – API Overload** | Too many requests causing slowness | **Medium** | Throttling API Gateway/AppSync, CloudWatch alarms |
| **R3 – Lambda Cold Start** | Delay when invoking | **Medium** | Optimize code, Provisioned Concurrency if needed |
| **R4 – Cost Overrun** | Unusual usage increase (high emails) | **Medium** | AWS Budgets alerts, monitor Cost Explorer |
| **R5 – Service Downtime** | AWS Outage | **Low** | Multi-AZ config, backups DynamoDB |

**Contingency Plan (Summary):**
- Recovery: Use CloudFormation to quickly recreate infrastructure in the event of a failure or deployment error.

- Monitoring & Alerting: Set up CloudWatch alarms to detect performance, security, and cost issues early, send email notifications to the operations team.

- Continuous Improvement: Periodically evaluate CI/CD processes, automate testing, optimize pipelines, and update documentation to ensure the system is always stable and easy to maintain.
