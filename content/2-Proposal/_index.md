# Serverless Student Management System

## Cloud-based serverless student management system for students and small businesses

### 1. Executive Summary

Serverless Student Management Platform is a cloud-based student management platform designed for educational institutions and small businesses to enhance the management, analysis, and interaction of student data. The platform supports up to 50-100 students initially, with the ability to flexibly scale up to 500-1000 students without major infrastructure changes, using AWS Serverless services such as Lambda, DynamoDB, AppSync, and EventBridge.

Users can access it via a friendly web interface (supporting real-time chat for assignments and comments) combined with APIs for real-time data transmission, ensuring high interactivity. The platform leverages AWS to provide centralized management (secure data storage), predictive analytics (via Personalize for score rankings and recommendations), reminder notifications (via SES), and system monitoring (via CloudWatch), while optimizing costs by charging only for actual usage.

### 2. Problem Statement

**Current Issues**

Current student management systems require manual data entry, making it difficult to manage multiple classes. There is no centralized system for data or real-time analytics, and third-party platforms are often expensive and overly complex. Lack of real-time communication features leads to delayed communication, absence of incentive mechanisms like diligence ranking, and manual exam event processing.

**Solution**

The platform uses Amazon API Gateway to handle REST requests, AWS Lambda for business logic processing, Amazon DynamoDB for storing student data and scores, and AWS AppSync with GraphQL for real-time communication. AWS Amplify with React/Next.js provides the web interface, and Amazon Cognito ensures secure access. Similar to traditional LMS systems but with lower costs, users can register new students and manage information, but this platform operates at a smaller scale and serves educational purposes. Key features include real-time management dashboard, learning trend analysis, and low operational costs.

**Benefits and Return on Investment (ROI)**

The solution creates a foundation for IT students to develop AWS serverless skills while providing efficient management tools for teachers in instruction and assessment. The platform reduces manual reporting for each class through centralized systems, simplifies management and maintenance, and improves data reliability. Monthly costs estimated at $7-20 USD (according to AWS Pricing Calculator), totaling $21-60 USD for 3 months. All AWS resources are used within free tier and low-cost options, with no additional development costs. ROI period of 3-6 months through significant savings in manual operations time and improved teaching efficiency.

### 3. Solution Architecture

The system is designed following the AWS Well-Architected Framework with interconnected layers, ensuring data management capabilities, authentication, monitoring, real-time communication, ML ranking, notifications, and continuous event processing. The serverless architecture helps optimize costs and ensures automatic scalability.

### 4. Technical Implementation

#### Implementation Phases

The project consists of 2 parts — developing a serverless student management system and building an intelligent analytics platform — each going through 4 phases:

1. **Research and Architecture Design**: Research AWS serverless patterns with DynamoDB and design architecture integrating realtime chat/ranking (1 month before internship).
2. **Cost Calculation and Feasibility Check**: Use AWS Pricing Calculator for estimation and adjust scope accordingly (Month 1).
3. **Architecture Adjustment for Cost/Solution Optimization**: Fine-tune (e.g., optimize Lambda with React SSR) to ensure efficiency (Month 2).
4. **Development, Testing, Deployment**: Program React frontend, AWS services with CDK/SDK and AppSync subscriptions, then test and deploy to production (Month 2–3).

#### Technical Requirements

**Student Management System**: Web dashboard (CRUD students, scores, courses), real-time chat, ML ranking. Frontend React/Next.js running on Amplify Hosting, using AppSync subscriptions to receive real-time chat messages and ranking updates. Cognito authenticates and authorizes all users, including 5-10 admins/teachers (with high privileges like CRUD data) and students (with limited privileges like viewing personal scores, joining chat).

**Intelligent Analytics Platform**: Practical knowledge of AWS Amplify (hosting React), Lambda (minimized due to SSR handling), AWS Personalize (ML ranking), DynamoDB (main NoSQL), AppSync (GraphQL + subscriptions), and EventBridge (event routing). Use AWS CDK/SDK for programming (e.g., EventBridge rules to Lambda for notifications). React SSR helps reduce Lambda load for fullstack web applications.

### 5. Roadmap & Key Milestones

The project is implemented over 14 weeks (from September to December 2025), divided into 6 main phases following the Agile model.

- Can reduce further if using AWS Educate / Credits for Students.
- Personalize & SES costs based on volume; optimize with batch processing.
- EventBridge costs based on number of events; optimize with filter rules.

### 7. Risk Assessment

Based on NIST Risk Management Framework, the project team identifies key risks and mitigation measures.

| **Risk Code**                     | **Description**                            | **Level**  | **Mitigation**                                               |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **R1 – Data Leakage**             | Data exposure due to misconfiguration      | **High**   | Apply Cognito auth, IAM least privilege, DynamoDB encryption |
| **R2 – API Overload**             | Too many requests causing slowdown         | **Medium** | Throttling API Gateway/AppSync, CloudWatch alarms            |
| **R3 – Lambda Cold Start**        | Delay on invocation                        | **Medium** | Optimize code, Provisioned Concurrency if needed             |
| **R4 – Cost Overrun**             | Unusual usage increase (high chat, emails) | **Medium** | AWS Budgets alerts, monitor Cost Explorer                    |
| **R5 – Service Downtime**         | AWS interruption                           | **Low**    | Multi-AZ config, DynamoDB backups                            |
| **R6 – Realtime Latency**         | Chat delay due to subscriptions            | **Medium** | Use AppSync caching, test with high load                     |
| **R7 – ML Accuracy**              | Inaccurate ranking due to poor data        | **Medium** | Validate datasets, periodic retraining with Lambda           |
| **R8 – Event Processing Failure** | Error routing exam events                  | **Medium** | Dead-letter queues for EventBridge, test rules               |

**Contingency Plan (Summary):**

- Recovery: Use CloudFormation for fast rebuild.
- Communication: CloudWatch alarms send emails.
- Continuous Improvement: Weekly review, including chat performance, ranking, and event handling.
