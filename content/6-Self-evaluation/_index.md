From **September 08, 2025 to December 28, 2025**, I had the honor of participating in the **First Cloud Journey** program organized by AWS Vietnam. This was an invaluable opportunity for me to gain hands-on experience with cloud technology, contribute to building and deploying solutions on the AWS platform, and work alongside experienced mentors and talented fellow interns.

Through weeks of learning, hands-on practice, and the execution of our group project — **Serverless Student Management System**, a fully serverless student management platform (similar to university LMS systems) — I significantly strengthened and expanded my knowledge of AWS services including **Route 53, Cognito, Amplify, WAF, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, EventBridge, AppSync (GraphQL), SES, CloudFront, and CloudWatch**. At the same time, I improved my programming skills, teamwork abilities, presentation skills, and gained practical experience working with **GitLab**.

Regarding work attitude, I consistently maintained a serious learning mindset, fully complied with the program’s rules and processes, proactively collaborated with team members, and strictly respected deadlines and established workflows.

To objectively reflect on my internship period, I would like to evaluate myself based on the following criteria:

### Areas for Future Improvement

- Further strengthen personal discipline, especially regarding punctuality and time management, particularly under high-pressure deadlines toward the end of the program.
- Enhance presentation skills and professional English communication in an international working environment.
- Develop stronger systems thinking and advanced debugging capabilities to resolve production-level issues more quickly and accurately.
- Take a more proactive role in code reviews and knowledge-sharing sessions to build technical leadership skills in the future.

The First Cloud Journey program has truly been a major milestone in my academic and professional journey. I am deeply grateful to AWS Vietnam, the mentors, and my teammates for their guidance and companionship throughout this meaningful period.
