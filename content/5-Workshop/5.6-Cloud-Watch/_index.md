## Overview

This section guides you through using Amazon CloudWatch to monitor, alert, and manage services in the Serverless Student Management System on AWS. You will learn how to create log groups for Lambda, set up alarms for Lambda errors and performance, API Gateway, and build a visual dashboard to track the entire system's operations. Proactive monitoring helps detect problems early, optimize operations, and effectively control AWS costs.

## CloudWatch (Monitoring)

### 1. Create Log Groups

Lambda automatically creates log group: `/aws/lambda/student-management-api`
