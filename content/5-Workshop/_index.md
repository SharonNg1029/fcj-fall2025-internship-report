# Serverless Student Management System on AWS

## Overview

**Serverless Student Management Platform** is a cloud-based student management solution, cost-effective and flexible scalability thanks to the use of **AWS Serverless** services (Lambda, DynamoDB, API gateway...). The platform supports up to 50-100 students initially, with the ability to flexibly expand to 500–1000 students without major infrastructure changes.

Core services: API Gateway (REST), Lambda handles business logic, DynamoDB stores data, Amplify (frontend React), Cognito (user authentication), CloudWatch (monitoring), combined with modern DevOps CI/CD processes.
