- Tech stack proposed: DynamoDB (Database), Lambda (Backend Logic), API Gateway (REST API), Cognito (Authentication), S3 (Frontend Hosting).

**2. Detailed System Analysis:**

- **Use Cases & User Stories:** Fully listed for Admin, Lecturer, and Student roles.
- **Business Flowcharts:** Created for Login (Cognito) and Assignment Submission flow.
