**In this page**, I share my entire internship journey at FCJ (First Cloud Journey) – a **14-week** training program (from 08/09/2025 to 14/12/2025).  
This is my first time systematically learning and practicing AWS services from foundational to advanced levels, while also completing a Serverless group project called **Serverless Student Management System**.

Over the 3.5 months of internship, I went through several stages:

- Week 5–6: Learning Decoupling, advanced Security, and starting project ideation
- Week 7–8: Choosing project topic, designing architecture, and reviewing for the midterm (4 pillars: Security, Resilience, Performance, Cost Optimization)
