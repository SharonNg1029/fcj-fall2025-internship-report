**On this page**, I document my entire internship journey at FCJ (First Cloud Journey) – a **14-week** training program (from September 8, 2025 to December 14, 2025). This was my first time systematically learning and practicing AWS services from fundamental to advanced levels, while also completing a serverless group project called **Serverless Student Management System**.

During the 3.5-month internship, I went through the following phases:

- Weeks 5–6: Learning Decoupling, advanced Security, and project ideation
- Weeks 7–8: Selecting the project topic, designing the architecture, and preparing for the midterm exam (4 pillars: Security, Resilience, Performance, Cost Optimization)
- Weeks 9–10: Business analysis, Proposal writing, UI/UX design
- Weeks 11–13: Frontend development (React + TypeScript), Cognito integration, API Gateway, CloudFront + WAF, Route53
