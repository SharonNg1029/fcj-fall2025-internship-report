### [Blog 1 - Introducing Strands Agents, an Open Source AI Agents SDK](3.1-Blog1/)

Strands Agents is an open-source SDK that simplifies building and deploying AI agents using a model-driven approach, requiring just a few lines of code. It powers production systems at AWS teams like Amazon Q Developer and AWS Glue, enabling faster development from months to days while leveraging LLMs for planning, tool calls, and reflection. Key features include seamless tool integration (20+ pre-built tools and thousands via MCP), support for multiple models (Bedrock, Claude, Llama, Ollama), and production-ready deployment on AWS services with OpenTelemetry observability.

### [Blog 2 - Introducing managed accounting for AWS Parallel Computing Service](3.2-Blog2/)

AWS Parallel Computing Service (PCS) introduces managed accounting to simplify HPC management with Slurm, offering resource monitoring, usage limits, and project attribution for chargeback and budgeting. This eliminates the need for separate databases, providing clear visibility into "who did what" for better reporting and capacity planning. Enable it during cluster setup with Slurm 24.11+, configure via console, and leverage use cases like job attribution, CPU limits to prevent hoarding, utilization reports, and failure analysis. Pricing includes hourly fees by cluster size plus GB-month storage—start in the AWS PCS console for efficient, scalable HPC operations.

### [Blog 3 - Simplify AWS AppSync Events integration with Powertools for AWS Lambda](3.3-Blog3/)

AWS AppSync Events powers real-time WebSocket features, and the latest Powertools for AWS Lambda introduces AppSyncEventsResolver for Python, TypeScript, and .NET—streamlining event handling with pattern routing, filtering, transformation, and error management. Set up handlers for PUBLISH and SUBSCRIBE using intuitive channels and wildcards, slashing boilerplate code while ensuring robust authorization, full event access, and optimized aggregation. This lets developers focus on business logic without Lambda disruptions, perfect for chat apps, live dashboards, or IoT systems—boosting performance in real-time experiences.
