### General Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**

The environment at FCJ is highly dynamic and values a spirit of ownership. The working atmosphere is professional yet comfortable enough for me to openly exchange ideas with mentors. However, the noise level when crowded can be distracting at times, but the policy allowing headphones has effectively solved this issue.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**

The mentors are extremely dedicated and always available when support is needed. I highly appreciate that they encourage me to try and solve problems independently rather than just providing the answers immediately.

**3. Relevance between work and major**

The assigned tasks have a progressive level of difficulty, which is very suitable for the roadmap of a 3rd or 4th-year student. I have had the opportunity to apply foundational knowledge of Programming and Computer Networking learned at university to a real-world Cloud environment.

**4. Learning opportunities & Skill development**

During the internship, I learned many new skills such as using project management tools, teamwork, and professional communication within a corporate environment. Mentors also shared a lot of practical experience, helping me better orient my future career path.

**5. Culture & Team Spirit**

From the beginning of the First Cloud Journey, I was very impressed by the community's team spirit. Everyone respects one another; we work seriously but maintain a fun atmosphere. Support is given regardless of whether one is an intern or a full-time employee, which makes me feel like a true part of the collective.

**6. Policies / Benefits for Interns**

I particularly enjoy the Workshops/Events organized by AWS; these help me and other students access new knowledge and gain opportunities to network with seniors in the field. Additionally, the Hybrid working model provides favorable conditions for time flexibility and comfort.

### Other Questions

- **What are you most satisfied with during the internship?**
  I am most satisfied with the program's policies and regulations, which create very favorable conditions for participants. Additionally, the friendliness and readiness of mentors to help and answer questions is a highlight.

- **What do you think the company needs to improve for future interns?**
  The documentation is very deep and extensive, so I was quite confused in the beginning. I hope the team can update the guidance to provide a more detailed direction/roadmap.

- **If you were to introduce this to friends, would you recommend interning here? Why?**
  Definitely yes. This is an ideal place to experience work culture. The company organizes many events that provide both new knowledge and job opportunities for students. Especially, the mentors are all dedicated to answering questions and supporting students.

### Proposals & Desires

- **Do you have any suggestions to improve the internship experience?**
  Since most interns are about to graduate, I suggest the team organize additional workshops/talkshows regarding Job Interviews, working experiences, or in-depth CV reviews. This would help interns review missing knowledge and feel more confident when applying for official positions at the company

- **Do you want to continue this program in the future?**
  Yes, I really hope to continue accompanying the First Cloud Journey program in the future.
