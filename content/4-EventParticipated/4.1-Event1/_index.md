## Key Highlights

### 1. The FCJ Vision & Impact

- **Legacy:** Since 2021, FCJ has trained over **2,000 students**, creating a pipeline of **150+ alumni** currently working at top tech companies.
- **Mission:** To build a high-quality generation of **AWS Builders** for Vietnam, capable of competing globally.
- **Ecosystem:** The program is deeply connected to the **AWS Study Group (47,000+ members)**, providing a massive support network for new joiners.

### 2. Industry Insights & Career Accelerators

- **Rapid Growth:** The sharing session highlighted how Alumni transitioned from Interns to roles like _Principal Cloud Engineer_ or _GenAI Engineer_ in just **1–3 years**.
- **Key Trends:** The shift from traditional SysAdmin to modern roles requires a mix of **Cloud Native**, **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**, and **Generative AI** skills.
- **Recruitment Reality:** Employers are looking for "Builders" who can demonstrate practical project experience, not just certificate holders.

### 3. The "Builder" Mentality

- **Core Advice:** "Learn fast – build real projects – ask early – share more."
- **Proactivity:** Success in the OJT program relies 80% on the intern's proactivity in seeking mentorship and solving problems independently before asking.

## Key Takeaways

### Mindset & Culture

- **Contribution Culture:** Knowledge grows when shared. Active participation in the community is the fastest way to learn.
- **Fail Fast, Learn Faster:** Don't be afraid to break things in the lab environment. It's better to fail during OJT than in a production environment.

### Career Strategy

- **T-Shaped Skills:** Build a broad foundation in AWS services (Compute, Network, Storage) but develop deep expertise in one domain (e.g., Serverless or GenAI).
- **Network is Net Worth:** The relationships built with mentors and peers in this program are future professional connections.

### Skill Orientation

- **Focus Areas:** The current market demands proficiency in **Serverless** (Lambda, API Gateway), **Terraform/CDK**, and **CI/CD pipelines**.
- **Soft Skills:** Communication and documentation are just as critical as coding.

## Applying to Work

- **Define Roadmap:** Set a clear goal for the 4-month internship: Achieve the **AWS Solutions Architect Associate** certification and complete one end-to-end capstone project.
- **Portfolio Building:** Commit to documenting every weekly task and project milestone on GitHub and personal blogs (like this Hugo site).
- **Mentorship Engagement:** Schedule bi-weekly checkpoints with the assigned mentor to review code quality and discuss architectural decisions for the _Student Management System_ project.

## Event Experience

The Kick-off event was more than just an orientation; it was a motivational booster.

- **Inspiration:** Hearing specific stories from alumni like **Nguyen Dong Thanh Hiep** (Principal Cloud Engineer) proved that a steep career trajectory is possible with the right focus.
- **Atmosphere:** The energy at the AWS Office was palpable. Being surrounded by 300+ like-minded peers created a sense of belonging to a "technical elite" squad.
- **Direct Connection:** I had the opportunity to listen directly to Mr. Nguyễn Gia Hưng, and his vision for Vietnam’s technology workforce truly motivated me to strive harder.
