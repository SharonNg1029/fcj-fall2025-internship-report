# Summary Report: AWS Cloud Mastery Series #1 - ​AI/ML/GenAI on AWS

## Event Objectives

- Gain a comprehensive overview of the AI/ML landscape in Vietnam and the AWS ecosystem.
- Understand the end-to-end Machine Learning lifecycle using **Amazon SageMaker**.
- Explore Generative AI capabilities with **Amazon Bedrock**, focusing on Foundation Models (FMs), RAG, and Agents.
- Learn practical techniques for Prompt Engineering and building AI-powered applications without deep data science expertise.

## Time & Venue

**Time:** 08:30 – 12:00, Saturday, November 15 2025  
**Venue:** 26th Floor, Bitexco Financial Tower, 2 Hai Trieu Street, Ben Nghe Ward, District 1, Ho Chi Minh City

## Speakers

- **Dinh Le Hoang Anh** – Cloud Engineer Trainee, First Cloud AI Journey
- **Lam Tuan Kiet** – Sr. DevOps Engineer, FPT Software
- **Danh Hoang Hieu Nghi** – AI Engineer, Renova Cloud

## Key Highlights

### 1. AWS AI/ML Services Overview (SageMaker)

- **End-to-end Platform:** Amazon SageMaker is not just for training; it covers the entire lifecycle from data preparation (Data Wrangler) to deployment and monitoring.
- **MLOps Integration:** The importance of integrating ML workflows with DevOps practices (CI/CD for ML) to ensure reproducible and scalable model deployment.
- **Live Demo:** A walkthrough of **SageMaker Studio**, demonstrating how to label data, train a model, and deploy an endpoint in a unified interface.

### 2. Generative AI with Amazon Bedrock

- **Serverless GenAI:** Bedrock allows access to high-performing Foundation Models (Claude 3, Llama 3, Titan) via a single API, removing the need to manage infrastructure.
- **Model Selection:** Guidance on choosing the right model based on cost, latency, and reasoning capability (e.g., using Claude for complex reasoning vs. Titan for simple summarization).
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** The architecture for connecting LLMs to private data (Knowledge Bases) to reduce hallucinations and provide accurate, context-aware answers.

### 3. Advanced GenAI Features

- **Prompt Engineering:** Techniques like _Chain-of-Thought_ and _Few-shot learning_ to steer model behavior effectively.
- **Bedrock Agents:** Building multi-step workflows where the AI can execute API calls to perform tasks (e.g., booking a meeting, querying a database).
- **Guardrails:** Implementing safety filters to prevent the generation of harmful or inappropriate content.

## Key Takeaways

### Design Mindset

- **Democratization of AI:** You don't need to be a PhD in Math to use AI. With services like Bedrock, software engineers can integrate powerful AI features via APIs.
- **Context is King:** A generic model is less useful than a model grounded in your specific business data. RAG is the bridge between generic intelligence and business value.

### Technical Architecture

- **Managed Services vs. Self-hosted:** For most use cases, using managed services (Bedrock/SageMaker) is more cost-effective and secure than hosting open-source models on EC2 instances.
- **Safety First:** AI applications must have guardrails (input/output filtering) before reaching end-users.

### Applying to Work

- **Explore RAG Concepts:** Research the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture to understand the theoretical foundation of smart document search features.
- **Understand Data Privacy:** Learn the core principles of data protection (e.g., avoiding sending sensitive data to public models) to apply in future projects.
- **Data Privacy:** Ensure that any student data used for RAG follows strict encryption standards (KMS) and is not used to train public base models.

## Event Experience

The workshop successfully demystified the complex world of AI/ML.

- **Perspective Diversity:** Hearing from a Senior DevOps Engineer (FPT) and an AI Engineer (Renova) provided a balanced view between _operationalizing AI_ and _building AI models_.
- **Practicality:** The "Live Demo" of building a GenAI chatbot was incredibly valuable. It showed that building a functional prototype can take hours, not months.
- **Networking:** The ice-breaker activity and networking session allowed me to discuss the current demand for "AI-literate developers" in the Vietnamese market.
